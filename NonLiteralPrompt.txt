EXAMPLE:
Latin Text: "Obstipuēre omnēs nec tālia dicta probārunt,
ante omnesque Lelex animo maturus et aevo,
sic ait: “inmensa est finemque potentia caeli
non habet, et quicquid superi voluere, peractum est,
quōque minus dubites, tiliae contermina quercus
collibus est Phrygiis modico circumdata muro;
ipse locum vidi; nam me Pelopeia Pittheus
misit in arva suo quondam regnata parenti.
haud procul hinc stagnum est, tellus habitabilis olim,
nunc celebres mergis fulicisque palustribus undae;
Iuppiter huc specie mortali cumque parente
venit Atlantiades positis caducifer alis.
mille domos adiere locum requiemque petentes,
mille domos clausere serae;"
Literal English Translation: "All were awestruck nor did they approve of such words,
Before everyone Lelex, experienced in mind and age,
So said: “The power of the sky is great and has no end,
And whatever the gods have wished is accomplished,
So that you may doubt less, an oak tree
Next to a linden tree on Phrygian hills is surrounded by a modest wall;
I myself saw the place; for Pittheus sent me into 
Pelopeian fields that are ruled by his parent.
By no means far from here is a swamp, once habitable land,
Now waves, frequented by seagulls and water fowl;
Jupiter came here in mortal disguise, and
With his parent came Mercury the caduceus bearer after his wings had
been set aside They approached a thousand homes, seeking a place for rest,
But locks closed a thousand homes;"

NON-LITERAL TRANSLATION:
Translation:  The others were startled, and disapproved of his words, Lelex above all, experienced in mind and years, who said: ‘The power of the gods is great and knows no limit, and whatever heaven decrees comes to pass. To help convince you, in the hills of Phrygia, an oak and a lime tree stand side by side, surrounded by a low wall. I have seen the place, since Pittheus, king of Troezen, sent me into that country, where his father Pelops once ruled.
There is a swamp not far from there, once habitable land but now the haunt of diving-birds and marsh-loving coots. Jupiter went there, disguised as a mortal, and Mercury, the descendant of Atlas, setting aside his wings, went with his father, carrying the caduceus. A thousand houses they approached, looking for a place to rest: a thousand houses were locked and bolted.
